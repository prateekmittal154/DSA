Suppose that we want to go from a location to A to B and there are multiple paths to go from A to B. Let these multiple paths be represented as S1, S2, S3, S4......


Constraint: A condition. Eg- We want to go from A to B in 12 hours. Then this is a kind of constraint

Feasible Soln: A soln that satisfies the constraint is a Feasible Solution. There can be multiple feasible solutions to a problem.

Next Constraint might be of the type ---> I need to minimize the cost

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Such Problems where the main task is to obtain a minimum or maximum solutions are called as <b> Optimisation Problems </b>

such solutions which are feasible as well as optimised are called - 'Optimal Solutions'

For a problem there can be many solutions, many feasible solutions but only one optimal solution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For any optimisation  Problem, we follow three kind of techniques:

1. Greedy Method
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Branch and Bound
