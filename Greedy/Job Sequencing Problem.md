<b><center><h1> JOB SEQUENCING PROBLEM (GREEDY APPROACH) </h1></center></b>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*PROBLEM STATEMENT:*

1. We are provided with 'n' jobs which are to be completed on a resource ( SINGLE INSTANCE)
2. Each Job i, has a deadline di>=1 and an associated profit pi>=0
3. Each Job gets completed in one unit of time
4. For each job, the profit pi is earned if and only if the job is completed before the deadline di
5. The objective of the job is to find the subset of jobs and their associated sequence such that the profit is maximised
