# QUICK SORT - DIVIDE AND CONQUER

+ At each step we place an element at its correct position
+ All elements to its left are smaller than it and the elements on the right are larger
+ This correctly placed element gives two sub-arrays- One on the left and the other on right
+ We repeat the quick sort procedure on both the sub arrays till the complete array is sorted
